FlickrPuttr
===========

FlickrPuttr is a little python script I wrote to solve the problem of getting a large number of images in folders uploaded to Flickr, adding them to sets. I tend to store all my images locally in folders, where the folder name is the name of the shoot. I wanted to be able to mirror this on Flickr, creating a single set per folder and uploading the photos to these sets. Nothing else appeared to work reliably, so I wrote FlickrPuttr.

FlickrPuttr is a console application that has a single dependency on the python flickrapi library (www.stuvel.eu/flickrapi) which is available in pip.
